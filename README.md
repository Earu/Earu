## üöÄ Intro 
Welcome to my profile you can find the diverse projets I've been working on **over the years**. A good part of them are related to the game that made me progress a lot in programming: *Garry's Mod*. The rest are projets that I've created following a specific need for example like [this](https://github.com/Earu/Octovisor).

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I do 
Nowadays I work mostly on *challenging projects* that involve learning **new frameworks** and solving *unconventional problems*. My favorite environment is the **.NET (Core)** framwork; I have accumulated a lot of experience on it over **the past 3 years** where I got to mess with two of its most well-known components **C# and F#**. I also sometimes tweak various **binary modules** to keep myself up to date with **C++** and I enjoy messing around with the latest web frameworks; typically **React** using **TypeScript or JavaScript** and playing around with **Lua** in Garry's Mod. **Rust** is something I'm looking forward to learn and use.
