## üöÄ Introduction
Welcome to my profile you can find the **diverse open-source projects I've been working on over the years**. A good part of them are related to the game that made me progress a lot in programming: *Garry's Mod*. The rest are projects that I've created following a specific need for example like [Octovisor](https://github.com/Earu/Octovisor) or are private. Some of the most complex projects I work / have worked on are not open-source because they're linked to my current job / past jobs, so for obvious reasons I cannot disclose them.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What I do 
Nowadays I work for one of the biggest IT related companies in the world (CAC40 etc...) as an **analyst programmer**. My work mostly consists of *challenging projects* that involve learning **new frameworks** and solving *unconventional problems*. My favorite environment and the one I use for work is the **.NET (Core)** framework; I have accumulated a lot of experience on it over **the past 5 years** where I got to mess with two of its most well-known components **C# and F#**. I also sometimes tweak various **binary modules** to keep myself up to date with **C++** and I enjoy messing around with the latest web frameworks; typically **React** using **TypeScript or JavaScript** and playing around with **Lua** in Garry's Mod. **Rust** is something I'm looking forward to learn and use.

## üåç Organizations
- [Energizers](https://github.com/Energizers) is my organization where all the projects linked to [Energize](https://github.com/Energizers/Energize) are located, one of my biggest projects.
- [Meta Construct](https://github.com/Metastruct) is where I contribute most of the code for Garry's Mod I produce that is open-source.
- [PAC Server](https://github.com/PAC3-Server) is where I participated in the development of a game server for people using [PAC3](https://github.com/CapsAdmin/pac3).
